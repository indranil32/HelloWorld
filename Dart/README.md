# PREREQUISITE 
  ============

If you have Flutter installed, you might not need to explicitly download the Dart SDK. Consider downloading the Dart SDK if any of the following are true:

	i) You don’t use Flutter.
	ii) You use a pre-1.21 version of Flutter.
	iii) You want to reduce disk space requirements or download time, and your use case doesn’t require Flutter. For example, you might have a continuous integration (CI) setup that requires Dart but not Flutter.

Get the Dart SDK **[here](https://dart.dev/get-dart)**



# RUN
  ===

There are two ways you can compile a code written in Dart:-

1. If you have the Dart SDK or the Flutter SDK installed, then you can simply just open up your terminal in the directory where you have your helloworld.dart file located and then type the following command in the terminal. As soon as you hit enter after typing the following command, you would see the output.

```
dart helloworld.dart
```

2. If you don't have the Dart SDK or the Flutter SDK installed or for some reason you don't want to go ahead with the first method, you can try this one out. First of all, open up your helloworld.dart file and copy all the code. Now, open **[DartPad](https://dartpad.dev/)**. This is the official website where you could write and run your dart code. This method will save you some storage space too as you don't need to install the Dart SDK for this method.
