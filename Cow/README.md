# PREREQUISITE

============

1. Now that you're all pumped up to get your neighborhood cows in on the action, you can download and compile the C++ [interpreter source](https://github.com/BigZaphod/COW/blob/master/source/cow.cpp) or this [compiler](https://github.com/BigZaphod/COW/blob/master/source/cowcomp.cpp) that generates a C++ version of the COW source. Enjoy!

Here is a [COW interpreter](https://github.com/BigZaphod/COW/blob/master/source/cow.k) written in the K Programming Language by jjayson.

You can also use [this](https://frank-buss.de/cow.html) online cow compiler to try your code!

# RUN

==============

1. Compile By ./cowcc (compiler) helloworld.cow which creates cow.out executable
2. Execute it ./cow.out
