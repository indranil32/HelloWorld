## Prerequisites
- Download Julia from here https://julialang.org/downloads/
- For platform specific installation instructions visit https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/
- You also have to set path environment variables to be able to run typing julia from command line. Otherwise you'll have to type whole path or use an VS Code with Julia extension or Intellij IDEA with Julia extension.

## Run
- In terminal type julia hello_world.jl (if you have set environment variable).
- Otherwise type path/to/installation/folder/bin hello_world.jl. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22240581/running-julia-jl-files
